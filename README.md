# OneSignal iOS Sample

OneSignal makes engaging customers simple and is the fastest, most reliable service to send push notifications, in-app messages, SMS, and emails.

This project demonstrates how to integrate OneSignal into an iOS app built with SwiftUI to handle your messaging needs, including push notifications, SMS text messages, email, and in-app messaging. Feel free to use this sample as a reference for your own iOS integration.

### In-app Message App Launch

Configure in-app messages to present to users on app launch.
